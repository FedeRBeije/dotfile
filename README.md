## Introduction

A friendly documantation on how to have a nice and smooth workflow with github's tools.

## Branching Strategy

A well-defined branching strategy is crucial for a smooth and organized development process.
Github offers a flexible branching model that can be adapted to various workflows.

- [ ] **Main/Branch:**

  - [ ] Main branch should represent the production-ready code.
  - [ ] Feature branches for new features or bug fixes.
  - [ ] Release branches for stable versions.

  # Branching Strategy

A well-defined branching strategy is crucial for a smooth and organized development process.
GitHub offers a flexible branching model that can be adapted to various workflows.

## Feature Branches

Feature branches are used for developing new features or addressing specific issues.
They allow for isolated development without affecting the `main` branch.

- **Creating a Feature Branch:**

  - Use a consistent naming convention (e.g., `feature/my-feature`).
  - Branch off from `main` and regularly merge `main` into your feature branch to stay up-to-date.

- **Development Workflow:**

  - Regularly push changes to the remote feature branch.
  - Conduct code reviews on the feature branch.

- **Merge Process:**
  - Once the feature is complete and reviewed, create a pull request to merge it into `main`.
  - Delete the feature branch after merging to keep the repository tidy.

## Release Branches

Release branches are used to prepare a stable version for deployment.
They allow for bug fixes and final adjustments before a release.

- **Creating a Release Branch:**

  - Branch off from `main` when the code is in a stable state for release.
  - Use a naming convention like `release/v1.0.0`.

- **Bug Fixes:**

  - Only bug fixes should be added to release branches.
  - Changes in a release branch should be merged back into `main` to keep it updated.

- **Release Process:**
  - Once the release is ready, merge the release branch into `main` and tag it with the version number.
  - Delete the release branch after merging.

## Hotfix Branches

Hotfix branches are created to address critical issues in production.
They allow for quick fixes without disrupting the regular development process.

- **Creating a Hotfix Branch:**

  - Branch off from `main` specifically to address the critical issue.
  - Use a naming convention like `hotfix/v1.0.1`.

- **Fixing Process:**

  - Implement the fix on the hotfix branch.
  - Merge the hotfix branch into both `main` and the current release branch (if applicable).

- **Closing the Hotfix:**

  - Once the hotfix is merged, delete the hotfix branch.

## Tips for Branching

- **Consistent Naming:**

  - Adopt a clear and consistent naming convention for branches to enhance readability.

## Pull Requests

# Pull Requests

Pull Requests (PRs) are a critical aspect of collaborative development. They facilitate discussion, code review, and the integration of new features or bug fixes into the main codebase.

## Create a Pull Request

When you're ready to merge your changes into the `main` branch:

- **Opening a PR:**

  - Navigate to the "Pull Requests" tab.
  - Click on "New Pull Request."
  - Choose the branches you want to merge and review the changes.

- **Reference Issues:**

  - Link your PR to related issues by mentioning the issue number in the description. For example, if your issue number is 123, mention it like this: `Fixes #123`.

- **Assign Reviewers:**
  - Assign team members to review your code. This fosters collaboration and ensures code quality.

### Review Process

Encourage a thorough code review process:

- **Inline Comments:**

  - Use inline comments to provide specific feedback on lines of code.
  - Address comments and make necessary changes before merging.

- **Status Checks:**

  - Require status checks to ensure that all tests pass before a PR can be merged.

- **Approvals:**
  - Require a specified number of approvals before merging to ensure consensus.

### Merge Conflict Resolution

If conflicts arise between branches:

- **Locally Resolve Conflicts:**

  - Pull the target branch into your local branch.
  - Resolve conflicts locally using your preferred Git tool.

- **Push and Complete Merge:**
  - Push the resolved changes to your remote branch.
  - Complete the merge on GitHub once conflicts are resolved.

## Tips for Pull Requests

- **Clear Descriptions:**

  - Provide a clear and concise description of the changes made in the PR.

- **Link to Issues:**

  - Reference related issues using the `Fixes #issue_number` syntax in the PR description.

- **Link to Project Boards:**
  - If the changes are associated with a project, mention it in the description, linking it like `Part of Project: [Project Name](link_to_project)`.

# Issues and Projects

Issues and Projects are powerful tools in GitHub for managing tasks, tracking progress, and organizing your development workflow.

## Issues

Issues in GitHub are not just for bug tracking; they are versatile tools for managing tasks, enhancements, and discussions.

### Create an Issue

- **Opening an Issue:**

  - Go to the "Issues" tab.
  - Click on "New Issue" and choose the type (bug, enhancement, task).

- **Labels and Milestones:**

  - Use labels to categorize and prioritize issues.
  - Assign issues to milestones for better organization.

- **Task Assignment:**
  - Assign issues to team members to clarify responsibilities.

### Reference in Pull Requests

When working on a feature or bug fix associated with an issue, reference it in your Pull Request to provide context and facilitate collaboration.

- **Reference in PR Description:**
  - Link your PR to the related issue using the `Fixes #issue_number` syntax in the description.

## Projects

GitHub Projects provide a visual way to manage and organize work within your repository.

### Project

- **Task Management:**

  - Add issues and pull requests to your project board.
  - Use project boards to visualize the progress of tasks.

- **Columns and Automation:**
  - Customize columns based on your workflow.
  - Implement automation to move cards automatically.

### Linking Issues to Projects

Projects and issues go hand in hand to streamline your workflow.

- **Linking Issues to Projects:**

  - When creating or editing an issue, associate it with a project under the "Projects" section.

- **Project Boards and Workflow:**
  - Utilize project boards to organize issues into different phases of your workflow (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).

### Conclusion

Issues and Projects are integral components of an organized and efficient development process on GitHub. Use them collaboratively to track tasks, manage progress, and ensure that your team is on the same page throughout the development lifecycle.
